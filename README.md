# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

A simple Flask web app that predicts whether a person has diabetes using machine learning. The project includes data preprocessing, model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM experiments), and a small frontend to enter patient data and get predictions.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for the diabetes dataset
- Hyperparameter search (RandomizedSearchCV) for RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Stacking ensemble experiment and threshold tuning
- Flask UI for entering patient features and getting a prediction

## Quickstart (local)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. (Optional) Train a new model:
   ```powershell
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
   This writes `diabetes_model.pkl` and `diabetes_model_meta.json` to the project root (used by the web app).

3. Run the web app (development):
   ```powershell
   python app.py
   ```
   Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

## Run for LAN access
To make the app reachable from other machines on your LAN, bind the Flask server to `0.0.0.0` (already set in `app.py`) and open the port 5000 in your firewall.

## Production / Deployment
Recommended options:
- Dockerize the app (build an image and run behind a reverse proxy)
- Use a WSGI server like Waitress (Windows) or Gunicorn (Linux) and proxy TLS via Apache / Nginx / OHS

## Notes on artifacts
- Model artifacts (`diabetes_model.pkl`, `diabetes_model_meta.json`) are generated by training and should not be committed to source control. Use an artifact store or Git LFS for large files.
